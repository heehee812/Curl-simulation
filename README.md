## Hackmet in Hackthon

**Hackmet** is a helmet that can give an alarm to the police or your emergency contacts after detecting a hit to a certain extent. 

We combined STM32 microcontroller with a communication module and Arduino as a sensor, fixing it in a helmet. I implemented the connect between
line message and the helmet.
